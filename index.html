                <p>A friend of mine was a guest at the White House for a weeked during the administration of Calvin Coolidge. Drifting into the
                    the President's private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries "That's is a pretty dress you are wearing this morning"
                    and you are a very attractive young woman"
                </p>
                <p>That was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon secretary in his life. it was so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary
                    blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, "Now, don't get stuck up.I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you would be 
                    a little more careful with your Punctuation"
                </p>

                <p> His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listedn to unpleasent things after we have heard sme praise of our
                    good points. A barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896, when he was running for President. One of theprominent Republicans
                    of that day had written a campaign speech that he felt was just a tifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster
                    all rolled into one. With great glee, this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just wouldn't do. It would have raised a tornado
                    of criticism. McKinley didn't want to hurt the man's feelings. He must not kill the man's splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say "no". Note how adroitly he did it.</p>

                <div id="extra">
                    <p> My friend that is a splendid speech, a magnificient speech, McKinley said. "No one could have prepared a better on. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it
                    quite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I must consider its effect from the party's standpoint. Now you go home and writea speech along line I indicate, and send 
                    me a copy of it."</p>

                    <footer> He did just that. McKinley blue penciled and helped him rewrite his second speech, and he became one of the effective speakers of the campaign.</footer>
